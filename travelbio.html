Did we mention traveling already? <em>Yeah</em>, that. She sees herself becoming a software engineer with a focus on cybersecurity and information assurance and one day operating social entrepreneurship projects on the side.</div>

          <h3>A list of the wild places she's traveled and what she's seen there:</h3>
          <ul id="bullets">
            <li><strong>1995</strong> - Born in Houston, Texas in the Women's Hospital</li>
            <li>Her family moved from Houston to Boston, MA where they were continuing their academic and professional careers in medical records and pharmacy</li>
			 <li>She attended schools there until her family relocated back to Houston when she was in 2nd grade.</li>
			  <li>When she was in 4th grade, she moved to (wait for it...) Prince of Wales, Alaska!</li>
			  <li>She absolutely <i>loved</i> the nature and climate of southeast Alaska, engaging in sports year round and climbing the largest mountain on the island with her 4th grade class</li>
			<li>But her family moved back down to Houston, particularly Sugar Land, for her 5th grade experience</li>
			  <li>By the end of her 5th grade year, she moved to Alaska again! Only this time, it was northern Alaska: a far away tundra called Nome, 50 miles away from <b>Russia</b>!</li>
			  <li>
				  She skipped 6th grade and went to 7th grade in an Honors Charter Science Academy. By 8th grade, she was back in Houston, Texas again.</li>
			  <li>By 9th grade, she was homeschooled and then her family moved to Nigeria where she went to boarding school for a year and a half!</li>
			  <li>She came back and graduated from her high school in Austin, Texas!</li>
			  <li>Amidst all the constant moving, she found time with her family to make internation trips to France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, the U.K., Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lichtenstein, Canada, and other places.</li>
			  <li>She relocated on her own to Boston, MA where she will try to make it big as a developer in a booming tech city.</li>
			  <li><strong><em>Stay tuned:</em></strong> she'll be making her way to Spain and Portugal this May 2017!</li>
          </ul>
